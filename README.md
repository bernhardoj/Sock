Sock is kind of an automation app that can automatically do some actions based on the time you set. 
You just need to set the rule, describes below:
  - Rule label
  - Time (hour, minute, and day)
  - Frequency (Is it repeating every week?)
  - Action (explained on the next section)

### Actions
- Mute <br>
  Your device volume stream will be automatically muted and Do Not Disturb will be toggled on immediately when the rule is applied. 
  List of the volume stream that will be muted:
    - Alarm
    - Music
    - Notification
    - Ring
    - System

- Shutdown <br>
